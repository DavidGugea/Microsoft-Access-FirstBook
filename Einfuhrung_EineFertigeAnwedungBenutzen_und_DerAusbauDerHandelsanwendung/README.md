###In this folder I have the first three chapters of the book.
####In the first chapter didn't have much practice to it but it had a lot of very important general information about databases, like what is an ERM ( Entity-Relationship-Modell ), what is RDBMS ( Relational Database Management System ) and many others.
####In the second chapter I learned how to use a ready-made access database. The book came with a .zip file with all the needed Databases
####In the third chapter I've learned how to modify an already made database.

### At the end of the third chapter I had 2 proejcts, one project was for a 'car-dealership' company and the other project was for a 'craft-bussiness". I have done the projects by myself with no help from the book after I've finished chapter 3 and they both worked out.
